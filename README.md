## About
**AgentLang** is a programming language designed exclusively to model agent-based simulations. It has simple syntax and easy usage, yet it is powerful and can handle complex simulations with hundreds of agents.

## Source code
AgentLang consists of two main parts, which is the [Interpreter](https://github.com/TomasBoda/agent-lang-interpreter) and the [Code Sandbox](https://github.com/TomasBoda/agent-lang-web).

### Interpreter
AgentLang [Interpreter](https://github.com/TomasBoda/agent-lang-interpreter) is written purely in TypeScript and uses the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime framework.

### Code Sandbox
AgentLang [Code Sandbox](https://github.com/TomasBoda/agent-lang-web) is a web interface that provides a live code sandbox with a code editor and a live visualisation for trying out AgentLang without further configuration.

To try out AgentLang, visit the [Code Sandbox](https://agent-lang-web.vercel.app) website.

## Documentation
Documentation to the AgentLang programming language can be found on the [Documentation](https://agent-lang-web.vercel.app/documentation) page of the AgentLang website.
